=== Quality Scenarios

[options="header"]
|===
| Quality attribute | Scenario | Approach
| Usability |  We want to have a way of filtering the products that makes the searching process faster for the client | We develop a primitive search engine and classification for the types of products.
| Usability | Fast paying process | We developed an easy check out process that is called directly from the cart.
| Decentralization | Decentralization of the log in process (serverless) | It is gained by means of calling the Pod service provider and delegating the process to it.
| Privacy | We don't want to put in danger user data | Unless it is required by the client the application will not show any personal data.
| Accesibilty | We want to traverse the application easily | Intuitive navigation bar present in every route of the application.
