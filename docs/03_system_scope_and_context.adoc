== System Scope and Context

The application, called DeDe, is a privacy-aware retail system, that aims to provide users
a way to buy goods without having their data compromised. To do this, the user data will
be fetched from a Solid project Pod, provided that authorization is granted by the user. 
The application will provide the user with a way to place orders, as well as 
allowing the user to view past ones. It also has capabilities to calculate
the cost of the item bought.

=== Business Context

The user, unidentified, is able to browse products in the store and add them to
the cart. However, they must identify themselves if they want to buy. Once they
have logged in to their Pods, the system fetches their data and uses it
to place an order.

The system stores the products in a regular database, and asks the Pod system
for user data when needed (to see previous orders or to see their address).

=== Technical Context

The user will interact with the UI made in React. All product data will be stored in a MongoDB database, which will
be behind a RESTful API, and user data will be fetched from any Solid Pod system, making use of our custom
Solid facade and Solid RESTful API.
The application itself will be written in nodejs with TypeScript, and will be deployed in heroku.
