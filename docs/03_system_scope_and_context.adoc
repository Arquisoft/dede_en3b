== System Scope and Context

The application, called DeDe, is a privacy-aware retail system, that aims to provide users
a way to buy goods without having their data compromised. To do this, the user data will
be fetched from a Solid project Pod, provided that authorization is granted by the user. 
The application will provide the user with a way to place orders, as well as 
allowing the user to view past ones. It also has capabilities to calculate
the cost of the item bought.

=== Business Context

The user, unidentified, is able to browse products in the store and add them to
the cart. However, they must identify themselves if they want to buy. Once they
have logged in to their Pods, the system fetches their data and uses it
to place an order.

The system is structured in two parts. It has a frontend and a backend. The user
only interfaces with the frontend, which in turn interfaces with the
backend, which theen works with the SOLID POD provider and the database
serve the data the frontend might need.

=== Technical Context

The frontend of the application is made with React and Material UI, and has a Shipping API
which uses a bing service, VirtualEarth, to calculate distance and shipping costs.
It also uses Redux to store the cart state.

The backend uses Express and NodeJS to serve the data. It has two RESTful APIs.
One is the regular REST API which fetches data from or saves data to a database, which
is built using MongoDB and Mongoose. The other API is the SOLID REST API, which uses
a custom SOLID facade to interface with the SOLID POD provider of the user, and 
fetch their data or save a new address they might have input.

The whole thing uses Git for the SCCS and GitHub as a means of distributing it.
Both parts are on their own Docker containers and deployed to their separate
Heroku APPs using GitHub Actions. Then, Google Domains and its DNS service are
used to fuse the app under one domain.

The application is tested using Jest.
