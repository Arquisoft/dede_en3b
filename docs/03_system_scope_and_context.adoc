The user gives permission to use their data via the POD system, then he can browse products
placed by vendors, order new items or see their previous orders.

The system stores the products in a regular database, and asks the POD system
for user data when needed (to see previous orders or to see their address).

The user will interact with the UI made in React. All product data will be stored in a MongoDB database, which will
be behind a RESTful API, and user data will be fetched from a POD system (which is yet to be disclosed).
The application itself will be written in nodejs with typescript, and will be deployed in heroku.
