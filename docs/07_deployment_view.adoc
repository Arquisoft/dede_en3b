== Deployment View


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The deployment view describes:

 1. the technical infrastructure used to execute your system, with infrastructure elements like geographical locations, environments, computers, processors, channels and net topologies as well as other infrastructure elements and

2. the mapping of (software) building blocks to that infrastructure elements.

Often systems are executed in different environments, e.g. development environment, test environment, production environment. In such cases you should document all relevant environments.

Especially document the deployment view when your software is executed as distributed system with more then one computer, processor, server or container or when you design and construct your own hardware processors and chips.

From a software perspective it is sufficient to capture those elements of the infrastructure that are needed to show the deployment of your building blocks. Hardware architects can go beyond that and describe the infrastructure to any level of detail they need to capture.

.Motivation
Software does not run without hardware.
This underlying infrastructure can and will influence your system and/or some
cross-cutting concepts. Therefore, you need to know the infrastructure.

.Form

Maybe the highest level deployment diagram is already contained in section 3.2. as
technical context with your own infrastructure as ONE black box. In this section you will
zoom into this black box using additional deployment diagrams:

* UML offers deployment diagrams to express that view. Use it, probably with nested diagrams,
when your infrastructure is more complex.
* When your (hardware) stakeholders prefer other kinds of diagrams rather than the deployment diagram, let them use any kind that is able to show nodes and channels of the infrastructure.

=== Infrastructure Level 1

.Motivation
In our case the deployment view will be different depending on the stage of the project is on. For development and testing the execution environment will be on each student's machine. But for the production phase it will be deployed in a Dockerized environment hosted on Heroku. Above is the Deployment view of the latter, at the production stage.


.Quality and/or performance features
The performance on the deployment build will depend on the user's internet connection and the servers used for the deployment of the app since those are factors that we can not control. But the performance of the application can be maxed with posible improvements on our code.

|Element|Description
| Client | The device of the user, of course internet connection is required.
| Web server | Where we will host our app, all browsers should be compatible.
| POD provider | Solid pods will be provided by Solid Community
| WebApp | the front end of our application
| RestApi | the back-end of our application
| Database server | Where our databse will be hosted, since we are using mongoDB Atlas

=== Infrastructure Level 1.2

.Motivation
The motivation here, as stated in the previous point is similar, but this is how the deployment view would look for the development/testing environment

.Quality
The same as in the point above, nothing much changes, just the fact that all is hosted on the developer's pc.

|Element|Description
| Developer | The device of the developer, internet connection is needed to access the database.
| Development environment | The back-end and front-end will be hosted locally, in order to not make many changes on the deployment host.
| POD provider | Solid pods will be provided by Solid Community
| WebApp | the front end of our application
| RestApi | the back-end of our application
| Database server | Where our databse will be hosted, since we are using mongoDB Atlas

Describe (usually in a combination of diagrams, tables, and text):

*  the distribution of your system to multiple locations, environments, computers, processors, .. as well as the physical connections between them
*  important justification or motivation for this deployment structure
* Quality and/or performance features of the infrastructure
*  the mapping of software artifacts to elements of the infrastructure

For multiple environments or alternative deployments please copy that section of arc42 for all relevant environments.

Here you can include the internal structure of (some) infrastructure elements from level 1.

Please copy the structure from level 1 for each selected element.
