== Architecture Constraints


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Any requirement that constrains software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Simple tables of constraints with explanations.
If needed you can subdivide them into
technical constraints, organizational and political constraints and
conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions)

=== Technical constraints

[%header, cols=2]
|===
|Constraint
|Explanation

|SOLID
|For this project, we are required to follow the link:https://solidproject.org/[SOLID principles]. The use of PODs preserves the privacy of the customers as their data is stored in a decentralized way.

|React and Typescript
|The application will be implemented using the React framework and Typescript.

|Continuous integration system
|The application should be accessible and deployed using a continuous integration system.

=== Organizational constraints

|Constraint
|Explanation

|Git
|Our project will use a repository on GitHub in order to create a Version Control System.

|Team
|Our team is composed by five students of the course with a limited knowledge and experience in the technologies to use. The composition of the team will not be affected in the entirety of the project unless a member decides to drop the subject.

|Time
|The project will be developed in the span of the duration of the course, and so the time to finish the project will be limited.

=== Conventions

|===
|Constraint
|Explanation

|Design
|The application will have an overall pleasant aesthetic and should be easy to use by non-technical people, which means its interface should be intuitive.

|Documentation
|For the documentation we will follow the link:https://arc42.org/[arc42] template
