=== Reduced Pod storage

We do not store anything in the user's Pod whithout asking for confirmation, as we cannot be sure of what the user wants stored in it.
We do allow the user to add a new address to their Pod if they do not already have one or want to add a new one to the Pod.
We store all the necesary information in our database, keeping some references to the WebId of the users.
