=== Reduced Pod storage

We do not store anything in the user's Pod, as we cannot be sure of what does the user want stored in it.
We do allow the user to add a new address to their Pod if they do not already have one and want to add it to the Pod.
We store all the necesary information in our database, keeping some references to the WebId of the users.
