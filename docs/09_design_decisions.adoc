== Design Decisions

DataBase Management System::

[cols="1,1,3,3", options="header"]
|===
| **Technology** | **Used** | **Pros** | **Cons**

| MongoDB | Yes 
| Non relational database, stores information in JSON. Its query
language is based on JS, which happens to be the language we are
building the application on. Also, it is not neccesary to define
the tables. It is not the most used DBMS, but it is widely used
alongside JS.
| A bit slow, and does not support JOIN. It also has no query cache.

| MySQL | No
| Relational database, with tables and JOIN operations. It is more
similar to the DBMS we are used to. It also is widely used in the
industry, so a lot of docs are available.
| You have to define the schemas, and the query language is more
like SQL.

| SQLite | No
| Lightweight, proven, standard-of-the-industry. Comprehensive 
documentation. Most used DBMS in the world.
| Very basic, and does not support advanced operations that are
not basic SQL language.
|===

Continuous deployment system::

[cols="1,1,3,3", options="header"]
|===
| **Technology** | **Used** | **Pros** | **Cons**

| Heroku | Yes 
| Recommended by the teachers. We are somewhat familiar with it
already. Powerful and not too hard to use, as it is
just an environment for the server. Does not
require special code. Compatibility with docker
containers for deployment.
| Special code and configuration needs to be written. Free plan is 
a bit restrictive. Not a lot of documentation.

| AWS | No
| Serverless architecture. Powered by Amazon. It is the most used
cloud computing service.
| Hard to use. We are not so used to it, and it would impede application
development. We are not sure how well it works with Solid. We need
to write specific code for it.

About Solid::

[cols="1,1,3,3", options="header"]
|===
| **Option** | **Used** | **Pros** | **Cons**

| Design a custom API to work with the Pod | Yes
| Ease of use. Better code legibility. Generally more friendly
for the majority of the team. Only the person who develops it truly
needs to dig into how solid works.
| It needs to be built. If wrongly designed, it could hinder
development. Only the person who develops it truly needs 
to dig into how solid works.

| Use the Pod with just inrupt API | No
| More flexibility. Forces all the team to learn how Solid works.
| Hard and cumbersome to use. Poor legibility. Forces all the team
to learn how Solid works.
|===

RESTful API::

[cols="1,1,3,3", options="header"]
|===
| **Option** | **Used** | **Pros** | **Cons**

| RESTful API | Yes
| Separates client and server, yet makes it easier for them to work
together. Stateless and uniform interface.
| It needs to be designed. A poor design could hinder project
development.

| No API | No
| Faster to build. Easier to do and understand for a small project.
| Cumbersome, and rapidly loses legibility and cohesivity as
project size increases. Will incurr in a lot of technical debt.
|===


User Accounts::

[cols="1,1,3,3", options="header"]
|===
| **Option** | **Used** | **Pros** | **Cons**

| Use only the Pod to identify a user | Yes
| Allows for more privacy and aligns more closely with the Solid philosophy of decentralization.
| Can cause problems realted the constant access to the Pods and the Solid servers.

| Force users to have accounts | No
| Users get identified in our server and their info is stored in our database, reducing the interaction with Solid to a minimum.
| Goes against all the privacy and decentralization principles that Solid stands for.
