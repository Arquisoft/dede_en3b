== Design Decisions


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationals.
With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision should be documented
here in this central section or whether you better document it locally
(e.g. within the white box template of one building block).

Avoid redundancy. Refer to section 4, where you already captured the most important decisions of your architecture.

.Motivation
Stakeholders of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace your decisions.

.Form
Various options:

* List or table, ordered by importance and consequences or:
* more detailed in form of separate sections per decision
* ADR (architecture decision record) for every important decision

DataBase Management System::

[cols="1,1,3,3", options="header"]
|===
| **Technology** | **Used** | **Pros** | **Cons**

| MongoDB | Yes 
| Non relational database, stores information in JSON. It's query
languaje is based on JS, which happens to be the languaje we are
building the application on. Also, it is not neccesary to define
the tables. It is not the most used DBMS, but it is widely used
along JS.
| A bit slow, and doesn't support JOIN. It also has no query cache.

| MySQL | No
| Relational database, with tables and JOIN operations. It is more
similar to the DBMS we are used to. It also is widely used in the
industry, so a lot of docs are available.
| You have to define the schemas, and the query languaje is more
like SQL.

| SQLite | No
| Lightweight, proven, standard-of-the-industry. Comprehensive 
documentation. Most used DBMS in the world.
| Very basic, and does not support advanced operations that are
not basic SQL languaje.

Continuous deployment system::

[cols="1,1,3,3", options="header"]
|===
| **Technology** | **Used** | **Pros** | **Cons**

| Heroku | Yes (will be used)
| Recommended by the teachers. We are somewhat familiar with it
already. Powerful and not too hard to use, as it is
just an environment for the server. Does not
require special code. Compatibility with docker
containers for deployment.
| Special code and configuration needs to be written. Free plan is 
a bit restrictive. Not a lot of documentation.

| AWS | No
| Serverless architecture. Powered by Amazon. It is the most used
cloud computing service.
| Hard to use. We are not so used to it, and it would impede application
development. We are not sure how well it works with SOLID. We need
to write specific code for it.

About SOLID::

[cols="1,1,3,3", options="header"]
|===
| **Option** | **Used** | **Pros** | **Cons**

| Design a custom API to work with the POD | Yes
| Ease of use. Better code legibility. Generally more friendly
for the majority of the team. Only the person who develops it truly
needs to dig into how solid works.
| It needs to be build. If wrongly designed, it could hinder
development. Only the person who develops it truly needs 
to dig into how solid works.

| Use the POD with just inrupt API | No
| More flexibility. Forces all the team to learn how SOLID works.
| Hard and cumbersome to use. Poor legibility. Forces all the team
to learn how SOLID works.
|===

RESTful API::

[cols="1,1,3,3", options="header"]
|===
| **Option** | **Used** | **Pros** | **Cons**

| RESTful API | Yes
| Separates client and server, yet makes it easier for them to work
together. Stateless and uniform interface.
| It needs to be designed. A poor design could hinder project
development.

| No API | No
| Faster to build. Easier to do and understand for a small project.
| Cumbersome, and rapidly loses legibility and cohesivity as
project size increases. Will incurr in a lot of technical debt.
